--------------------------
list-->'in' membership testing -->O(n)
set-->'in'----->O(1)

how?
a set data structure is implemeted using hash tables
the elements of a set are immutable.
--> membership testing in an array -O(N)
 
" in hashing rather than storing a set of elements in table in sequence you want to store a collection of objects in memmory you can utilise a table or an array to store the elements in sequence , but the trouble is if you want to look up an element you have to scan the whole thing and that will take O(n).when you employ hashing you will assign a fixed position to each object in the table and computing  the fixed position is a constant time operation."


-----------------

--list in python is implimented as a c like array
  append operation in a list is O(1)
  insert operation in a list is O(n)
